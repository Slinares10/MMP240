<h2>Ingredients</h2> 
<ul>
   <li> 1 cup white sugar </li> 
   <li> 3 large eggs </li>
   <li> 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk </li>
   <li> 1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk </li>
   <li> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>


    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
    
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li> 
    
    <li>Melt sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until liquefied and golden in color.
    Carefully pour hot syrup into a deep 9-inch round glass baking dish, turning the dish to evenly coat the bottom; set aside.</li>
    
    <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla; beat until smooth. Pour egg mixture on top of caramel in the baking dish; place in a deep roasting pan. Carefully pour in enough hot water to come 1 inch up the sides of the dish.</li>
    
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until just set with a slight jiggle in the center, about 1 hour, checking after 55 minutes. Keep in mind the flan will continue to set as it cools. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer baking dish to a wire rack; cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin forming. Refrigerate for 3 hours or up to 3 days</li>
    
    <li>To serve, run a knife around the edges of the dish; carefully invert onto a rimmed serving plate and let caramel sauce flow over flan.</li>
    </ul>
